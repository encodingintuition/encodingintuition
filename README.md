### Hi there, I'm Christopher 👋
<hr>
I am passionate about Energy and Education!   

Renewable Energy helps the world evolve, create, and provide essential needs such as clean water and heat. Education empowers individuals and communities to grow to their fullest human potential, a harmony of knowledge, wisdom, and compassion.I write code in python, do research, create visualization to communicate information.
