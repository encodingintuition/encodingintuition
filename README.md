### Hi there, I'm Christopher ðŸ‘‹
<hr>
I am passionate about Energy and Education! Education empowers individuals and communities to grow to their fullest human potential, a harmony of knowledge, wisdom, and compassion. Renewable Energy helps the world evolve, create, and provide essential needs such as clean water and heat. I mainly write code in python.
